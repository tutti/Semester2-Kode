General notes:
--------------
Any time you enter an unknown player ID, you will be asked to supply a name to
associate with that ID. If the ID is not meant to be kept, simply ignore this
prompt.

When you exit the program, entered IDs and names will be saved so the names
don't need to be re-entered. To avoid having a player saved, use a negative ID
(less than 0) instead, as these do not get saved.
